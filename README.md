# README

The packages required are:
Numpy, tqdm, pandas, os, sklearn, keras, matplotlib

The project is organised into folders A1, A2, B1 and B2

Within each folder, there are 4 (A1 and A2) and 3 (B1 and B2) .ipynb files - one for each method that was used to solve each task

THe main.py file is in the folder 'pyfiles'

In the main.py file, only the most accurate model for each task is demonstrated

To run each model from preprocessing, training and testing, run the 'complete' file, e.g.'A1complete'

If you would prefer to only run the final models, run the 'finalmodel' file, e.g.'A1finalmodel'


Please note, running either of the A1 files will change the directory to one level up, enabling the datasets to be run

Therefore, one of these files must be run before running A2, B1 or B2


To see more comments which may be easier to read, the final models are saved as a .ipynb file in their respective folder
